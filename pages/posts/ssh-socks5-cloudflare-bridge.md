When routing development traffic through corporate firewalls that inspect non-standard ports, combining `cloudflared access tcp` over port 443 with a local SSH SOCKS5 tunnel (`ssh -p 2222 -N -D 1080`) yields maximum stability.

Always specify `ServerAliveInterval 15` and `ServerAliveCountMax 3` in `~/.ssh/config` to prevent silent half-open TCP timeouts when crossing NAT boundaries.
